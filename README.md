## Project 1
### Relationship between SoMe and Stocks (Sentiment analysis)

### Research Question
"Is it possible to use Reddit and Twitter data, to predict short term movement in price of highly discussed stocks on these platforms?"

### Description
We want to analyze whether we can predict short term movements in the price of stocks. We will do this by collecting data from the platforms Twitter and Reddit. We will retrieve data from tweets regarding certain stocks and posts/comments on subreddits involving investing, such as "WallStreetBets" and "Investing". We will perform sentiment analysis on the text in relation to the mentioning of the stocks, which we will then compare to the actual market valuations of those stocks, to predict whether the price goes up or down.
