## Project 1 - Relationship between sentiments in SoMe and the stock market 

### Description
In cooperation with 3 other university students.   
Analyzing whether stock movements can be predicted in the short term. We are doing this by collecting data from the platforms Twitter and Reddit. We retrieved data from tweets regarding certain stocks and posts/comments on subreddits involving investing, such as "WallStreetBets" and "Investing". By using natural language processing to determine the sentiment in relation to the specific stocks, and compareing this to the actual market valuations of these stocks, to predict whether the price goes up or down.

**Including**
  - Scraping Reddit and Twitter with API's
  - Transforming unstructured data to structured
  - Feature engineering with the use of natural language processing
  - Classifying stock movements using, but not limited to:
    - Random Forest
    - Extreme gradient boosting
    - Support vector machines
    - Logistic regression
